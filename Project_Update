I believe that we have all of the data we need. Dr. Hayden suggested building a neural network.
We can use the data from the Montreal database (the MWDD file) as training and test data and then have the network classify the stars in the gaia query file.
The gaia query file has the gaia and SDSS data.
The data should be loaded on the Jupyter notebook.
